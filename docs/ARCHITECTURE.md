# Architecture

Our build farm has a number of major components:

1. Jenkins Build Pipeline Configuration
1. Adopt build scripts
1. Supporting libraries

## Process

A rough structure of the build is as follows

### Jenkins Job

#### Regenerate Jobs

Jenkins CI jobs are generated by the Jenkins [regeneration pipelines](https://ci.adoptium.net/job/build-scripts/job/utils/) and placed into the <https://ci.adoptium.net/job/build-scripts/> location. These builds coordinate the entire process of nightly and release builds.
Documentation for this process can be found at [regeneration docs](https://github.com/adoptium/i-jenkins-pipelines/tree/master/pipelines/build/regeneration)

#### Pipeline Jobs

These are the first scripts run by the top level jobs. Which in turn invoke the downstream build jobs for each configuration/platform, deploying the results to GitHub. The majority of the code that defines this stage is contained within [build_base_file.groovy](https://github.com/adoptium/ci-jenkins-pipelines/blob/master/pipelines/build/common/build_base_file.groovy).

#### Individual Build Jobs

These are invoked by the parent pipeline job and each build creates the archives/installers for a given platform. The majority
of this code is defined in [openjdk_build_pipeline.groovy](https://github.com/adoptium/ci-jenkins-pipelines/blob/master/pipelines/build/common/openjdk_build_pipeline.groovy).
