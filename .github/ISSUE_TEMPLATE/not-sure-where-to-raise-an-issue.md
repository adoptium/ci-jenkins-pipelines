Unsure where to raise something? Here are some of the common places:

- If your issue is due to the way OpenJDK is built in a Jenkins environment, then this is the repository to raise it in - Describe your problem below
- If your issue is related to our end user shell scripts (not the jenkins groovy scripts), raise it in [temurin-build](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/)
- If your issue is related to our installers (as opposed to tgz/zip downloads), raise it in [installer](https://github.com/adoptium/installer)
- If your issue is related to and end-user visible issue with the JDK, or an underlying java bug, please raise it in [adoptium-support](https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium-support/issues)
- Otherwise, take a look at our TSC repository directory [here](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/TSC/#dependent-projects). If you're still not sure then join our [slack channel[(http://adoptium.net/slack) and ask on `#general`
